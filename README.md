# DDW2D

What I've done so far:
- Downloaded all datasets into the datasets folder
- combined and cleaned up all the datasets into data.csv via create.py
- visualised missing data(missing_data_visualisation.py) with seaborn
- created functions for filling in missing values with impute.py
- created functions to normalize/standardize data
