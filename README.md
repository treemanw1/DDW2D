# DDW2D

What I've done so far:
- Downloaded all datasets into the datasets folder
- combined and cleaned up all the datasets into data.csv via create.py
- visualised missing data(missing_data_visualisation.py) with seaborn
- created functions for filling in missing values with impute.py
- visualized feature ditrribution with feature_distribution_visualisation.py
- created functions to normalize/standardize data

To do list:
2. Model/Metrics
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- What metric to use?

3. Improvements/Iterations(Just ideas as of now)
- Figure out cross validation
- Outlier removal
- Imputation method
- Data Transforms

4. Optional stuff
- Statistical Imputation: condense impute.py into 1 function

Janani:
- Plot scatterplots for deaths against features

Charles:
- Task 2, probably can use some of the stuff I've done here alr
